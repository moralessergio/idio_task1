My [incomplete] solution for Idio's task 1

This is the first time I use twitter's api, so it took me a while to get around the authentication process. I ended using Abraham's authentication library, as recommended in the API documentation.

This project get's some tweets based on location. My first idea was to use the GET statuses/sample with a geoBox around Exeter and another for London, but couldn't make that request to work. So I ended up using a simple search (GET search/tweets) with random words. Failing to use a real random sample as provided by the API, ideally, I would generate a dictionary of words to search for in order to collect some statistics. This implementation only uses 1 word: norris

On the good side, there are 2 different searches based on geolocations. The first one is a search around Exeter (with a radious of 4 miles), and the second one is centered in London (with a radious of 10 Miles). 

The next step was, for each of the 2 streams, to iterate through the text fields and through each word. Then for each word, check wheather it is correctly spelled (omitting urls, hashtags, usernames, and capitalized words), and keep a counter. Finally, divide the number of misspelled words by the total number of words to normalize the scores and make them comparable.

I have to admit this was good fun, but not obvious for a first timer.
